#Some of the images arent loading, here is exrta code to see if they work this way. Also I had trouble with this issue in general beacuse I couldnt click on "sample_plots" folder as it says on the coding challenge instructions.
#Hopefully this can compensate for the images not working in some way. Thank you professor. 

# Box plots
png("boxplots.png", width = 800, height = 600)
gdp_boxplot
life_exp_boxplot
dev.off()

# Time series
png("time_series.png", width = 800, height = 600)
gdp_time_series
life_exp_time_series
dev.off()

# Scatterplots
ggsave("scatterplot_original.png", plot = p1, width = 10, height = 6)
ggsave("scatterplot_log.png", plot = p2, width = 10, height = 6)
